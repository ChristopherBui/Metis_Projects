# Project Luther Proposal
**Topic:** NBA Basketball

**Question To Answer:**
What relationships can be observed between certain factors and the amount of salary that an NBA player earns. 

**Description:**
The data will be web-scraped from www.basketball-reference.com.  Features to consider range from game statistics such as rebounds and free throw percentage, travel distance,  team location, education background, etc. This data will be gathered over the past 10-20 years, the time span of which is to be determined. After collecting and cleaning the data, each individual feature can be plotted against salary earned. Regression methods can then be implemented to see potential correlations between a specific feature and salary earned, and allow for prediction of salary earned with given conditions.
