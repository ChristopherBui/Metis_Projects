## Welcome!

I present you with my series of projects that I diligently worked on during my time at the intensive 12 week Metis Data Science Bootcamp in Seattle, Summer 2018. The projects cover a wide array of machine learning concepts including but not limited to linear regression, multivariable classification, natural language processing, and artificial neural networks to name a few.
